          A lot of technical terms get thrown around in DistroWatch articles and in the comments following our weekly news letter.
          In an effort to make the world of Linux, BSD and open source less confusing, especially to newcomers, we have compiled
          a glossary of commonly used terms. We present them in alphabetical order to make definitions easier to find.
